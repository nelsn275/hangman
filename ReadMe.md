# Overview

This is a hangman style word game that comes up with a random word from a preset list and displays the word using underscores. As the user guesses letters, the program keeps track of the number of guesses and if correct letters are guessed, replaces the underscores with the correct letter in the correct position. 

The purpose of this software is to familiarize myself with the Rust programming language. I felt like creating a word game would provide enough of a challenge, using a variety of coding principles, while staying simple enought to not overwhelm myself while teaching myself new syntax and style.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
